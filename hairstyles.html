<h2>Have you seen Maleficent yet?</h2>
<p>
Such a AMAZING movie! We were sooooo excited to go see it and loved every minute! If you want a great movie to take your kids to this summer–this is it! Boys and girls alike!

Naturally, since there was some pretty beautiful hair and makeup (SO fabulous!), we had to recreate one of Aurora’s hairstyles. She is every bit the Beauty, and loved her simple yet ethereal look.
